# mcsync
Synchronize your local minecraft server data with another server.

### Features
* No-IP (DynDNS) update on change
* Check if there is an already running minecraft instance
* Only updates changes
* Works with SFTP

### Use case
I initially wrote this program to sync my local copy of my minecraft server to my less powerful vServer which isn't capable of running a full instance of Minecraft. But when hosting a Minecraft server on your own machine which is not turned on all the time (unlike a server), other people will not be able to play on that server. So they can just use this tool to get a copy of the newest version and host it on their own.
